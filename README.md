# Hyperspectral-parameter-inversion
HyperSpectraAI: Physics-Guided Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Environmental Analysis

Core Innovations
• Hybrid Architectures

Water: First Transformer-Mamba-CNN co-design for COD/Chl-a retrieval

Soil: GNN-VAE with spectral-spatial heterogenity modeling

Vegetation: Spatiotemporal Transformer with phenology-aware CRF

• Physically-Constrained AI

Hard-coded chemical rules (e.g., NH₄-N ≤ TN)

Spectral dropout respecting Beer-Lambert law

Uncertainty-quantified outputs via MC Dropout

Applications
⌖ Water quality monitoring
⌖ Precision agriculture (soil organic matter mapping)
⌖ Vegetation dynamics tracking (LAI/Chlorophyll)

Code Features
